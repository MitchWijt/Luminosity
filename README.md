# Luminosity
Luminosity is a small rendering application, that currently is able to render cubes as entities together with directional lights. Users can make use of the ImGUI UI to create a scene of their liking. 

This project was mainly started to discover the world of graphical engineering and to learn more about it. 

## The plan
The plan is to make this into a interactive musical application. Which means users can create a scene of their liking while choosing a song (.wav) file which they can play. 

Once the music starts playing. The cubes and lights together with their components will move and change based on the freqiencies of the music that is playing.
